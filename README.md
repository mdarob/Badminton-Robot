# Badminton-Robot
The objective of this project is to design and built a badminton robot that can play with a human player. Due to the complexity of the mechanism, the project was divided into three phases. The objective of the first phase was to design and build a mechanism that can hit the shuttlecock with a racquet. A DC motor was used with a crankshaft for hitting mechanism. A servo motor was used in order to rotate the racquet to get a desired face angle to hit the shuttlecock. The release mechanism sent a timing signal to the microcontroller so the racquet was timed to make contact with the shuttlecock.
